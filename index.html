      <h2>WILSON</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Wison Chibudom David and I enjoy turning 
        complex problems into simple and beautiful designs.<br>
        I also do graphic designing with the use of corel draw and adobe photoshop.
        My Tech journey began in 2019 although I website was not all that serious 
        about it I was just marvelled that I could write codes that would work on websites and I did all that with HTML<br>
        Soon enough I got to learn about CSS and I built static website all through. So I am a good front-end developer I just started back-end and I am challenging my self in doing better at it.<br>
        I became serious about it during 2021 I did some projects but never hosted them.<br> I am open to all opportunites and jobs 
        that can come my way as I am open to learning about Tech, Programming and much more.
